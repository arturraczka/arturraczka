Hi! <br>
Thanks for visiting my readme. <br>
Below you can find relevant information about me and my journey into software development. <br>
<br>
I am learning software development for over a year. At this moment I am working half-time outside the industry and improving my backend skills in the rest of my time. <br>
Currently I am developing a full-stack application in Django (for warehouse and order management) for Wawelska Kooperatywa Spożywcza as a freelance. <br>
<br>
I'm skilled with Python Django and DRF. <br>
I use PyCharm as my main IDE.<br>
I know MySQL/PostgreSQL essentials and I understand core principles of structuring a database. <br>
I am familiar with HTML/CSS. <br>
Recently I've learned Bash scritping basics. <br>
<br>
I focus on learning best practices for security, readability and performance. <br>
And except technical skills I have excellent communication skills plus I am a very strong team player. <br>
<br>
<br>
Background and early years:<br>
My very first contact with programming languages was at the Gdańsk University of Technology where I studied Math and Bioinformatics for 5 years. Amongst heavy theoretical math we were learning basics of C++, Perl, MySQL and statistical analysis in R. After graduation I pursited a dream of building my own company (not a startup) and project Poza Schematem was created. As Poza Schematem we were delivering professional-level and certified trainings to hundreds of students from biggest tech universities in Poland a year. Later, Poza Schematem was merged with a new company, BIM Partners, providing professional services and tranings for design companies from Architecture and Construction industry. During covid-19 pandemic and breakdown in our field of services I decided to take a break from office work and sold my shares to my business partners. During those years, apart from many other responsibilites, I was developing and deploying our professional webpages and platform with online courses using WordPress. <br>
<br>
<br>
Some thoughts:<br>
Learning to code in my thirties? <br>
Yes. Better start late in something you like, than start early in something you don't. <br>
<br>
When I was a kid I loved to build structures with wooden bricks and lego.<br>
Web dev is like building structures with abstract bricks. That's so cool! <br>
