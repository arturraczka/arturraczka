<p>Hi! Thanks for having a look at my page!<br>
My name is Artur and I am all about in depth learning web dev and **creating robust Django apps**.</p>

---
<p>I am a Math graduate with broad working experience and many in-demand soft and social skills.<br>
Learning, learning, learning - this sums up my last year. This year I want to land my first job as junior web dev. </p>
 
My tech stack includes (but not only):
- Python/Django
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- WordPress

<p>Every tech company is desperately looking for mid/senior developers and engineers.
So, are you willing to create one of them? </p>

---
<p>I'm crazy about getting things done. I don't keep ideas in a drawer. If something is worth doing - I go for it. If not, I let it go.<br>
And I've spend my last few years on building healthy habits and discarding the bad ones. I love sauna and delibrate cold baths/showers.</p>

---
<p>Have a look at my projects and expect to see new coming soon.</p>
