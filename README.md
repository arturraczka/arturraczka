Hi! Thanks for having a look at my page!<br>
My name is **Artur** and I am all about in depth learning web dev and ***creating robust Django apps***.

I am a Math graduate with broad working experience and many in-demand soft and social skills.<br>
Learning, learning, learning - this sums up my last year. This year I want to land my first job as junior web dev.
 
My tech stack includes (but not only);
- Python/Django junior
- MySQL junior
- HTML basic
- CSS basic
- WordPress

Every tech company is desperately looking for mid/senior developers and engineers.
So, are you willing to create one of them?

I'm crazy about getting things done. I don't keep ideas in a drawer. If something is worth doing - I go for it. If not, I let it go.<br>
And I've spend my last few years on building healthy habits and discarding the bad ones. Among others, it ended in having **regular cold baths/showers**, even in winter.

Feel free to browse my public projects and expect to see new coming soon.

Have a great day!
